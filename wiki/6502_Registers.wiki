Y/SB, SB/Y, X/SB, SB/X and SB/S are low during PHI2.

SB[0...7] are high during PHI2 ("precharged")

If both S/S and SB/S are low and PHI2 is high, S register set to 0xFF.
Otherwise S value is refreshed if S/S is high, and replaced by SB value, if SB/S is high also.
S value stored in latch in inverted logic.
